## TDD With Python

This is a simple implementation and example to get a first glance about 
Test-Driven-Development. It is a very interesting way of coding.

## Usage

- Clone this repo
- Create a virtual environment with the python version present at `run_time.txt`
- Activate it
- Install the requirements `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Make sure that `PYTHONPATH` is also pointed to this project.
- Run tests: `python3 -m tests.src.entitties.test_employee`. In case of having another
modules to test, just point there or try to use only `...tests...`, instead of the full
module-path. This should run all of them.

Have fun! :)
